# GPT Templates and Evaluation Repo

## Overview

This repository holds GPT prompt templates, structured examples, and evaluation scripts.

## Folder Structure

- `gpt-templates`: Instructions and templates for GPT Assistants.
- `eval-tests`: Files and templates for evaluating GPT outputs.

## Usage

Maintain prompts and evaluation documents here. Regularly update based on test results and feedback.

## Quick-start
1. Clone repo, open `prompt-style-guide.md` (2-min read).
2. Copy any file in `format-templates/`, replace placeholders `{â€¦}`.
3. Paste full prompt (comments included) into ChatGPT or your LLM.
4. For dynamic prompts, start with `/prompt-generators/` and follow instructions.

## Changes

Template files carry a single version line; detailed history lives in CHANGELOG.md once v1.0.0 is released.
